sample_509,"Yesterday everyone was studying hard. The corridor of the female block dormitory on the 2nd level was quiet. No one has the heart to go out. All pious, all depressed. Exam is near. Empty human corridor. There is only one male ringworm who sings a discordant song. He thought some women would be attracted to his pheromones, then copulate with him? Stupid cat. Two creatures of different species are unlikely to copulate. Their pheromones don't match. The cat is really stupid. He continued to hum his dissonant song, hoping for the moon to fall into his lap. The moon is actually a large rocky fragment that resulted from a stray asteroid's collision with Earth billions of years ago. The moon is an ugly rock, full of mange-like craters on the cat's body, and the moon and Earth exert gravity on each other in equilibrium. So the fact is that nobody wants the moon and the probability of the moon falling into the lap is zero. The male ringworm cat's gaze was then fixed on a room at the end of the corridor, next to the stairs. The door of the room was not closed tightly, revealing a woman with smooth skin but a slight tan, perhaps the effect of sunbathing on Pangkor Island. The lustful cat just got even more lustful after seeing the woman being alone. Think about the cat, maybe he just took a bath in the hot tub behind the hostel. Armed with the logic of a cat \[read: cats have no logic!\] the male ringworm cat entered the room. The cat then sat in front of the door of the room, like a sphinx, and stared at the woman intently. The woman with smooth but slightly tanned skin responded to the cat's gaze. Like this, usually when an animal and a human make eye contact, the first to look away is the animal, because they usually feel threatened by the human gaze. But not the male mange cat. Yes, as a side note, the cat is black. They looked at each other for a long time. It's raining outside. It sounds like Japanese people playing go. Then the girl was hysterical. As if possessed by a ghost, he howled, whimpering. Loud and loud. He then saw an apple peeling knife on his desk and he knew he had to do it that night. The woman came out, with a swagger and went from room to room. The screams of the other girls got louder. Blood began to flow down the drains of the dormitory, mixing with rainwater. More and more blood, screams-getting slower. Finally the dormitory was quiet again, as usual. From the last room, a woman with smooth skin came out. Now his skin is no longer smooth. The cat kept meowing its dissonant song, walking to the male dormitory.",0,malaysia,1540225824.0,2018-10-22,fotosintesis,Malay

When I was in grade 1 junior high school, there was an Islamic religion teacher who was a bit perverted, and he really looked like an ugly bastard in a doujin (fat, midget, wearing glasses). In the past, when I was teaching in my class, on the morning of the first lesson, he was usually late, and he would come for about an hour using his car, usually driving first and then parking in front of the teacher's room. Entering class usually discusses something that leads to that first, learns little instead. He once told me that he once taught at a high school in Cempaka Putih and found a student who had difficulty having periods or something like that and *somehow* he helped the student to menstruate and become an adult *with my own way.* Then at the beginning of semester 2 and I became class president through a coup d'état, there were 2 new students entering second grade, both girls. IIRC one was skinny flat chested, the other looked a bit full and busty. That's when I sent 2 new girls I entered the class and met him immediately and asked him what your name was, etc. It was quite normal until he saw his name on the nametag where it was located on the chest. The busty one was held by him until he was holding a ball or smth which was flat chested when he held him he said ""where? how come the nametag doesn't make sense?"" he also made some strange statements about religion, like if for example you jerked off right after Suhoor during Ramadan and kept calling to prayer and you already have pre-cum, it's better to just keep going because it's redundant and you can still fast (tf dude?) in the end when I'm in class 2. He was transferred to another school because of rumors that a 3rd grader was locked up in the toilet and groped his underwear when I was in 3rd grade. He somehow made a return visit to my junior high school and the male students were greeted like literally heroes coming home from war from the 2nd floor to the memes ofc.

Ok, I will try to backup you and give reasons why people think that way Or maybe else😅😅. And I'm trying to find something that I can present. Ok, let's take an example, you are ustaz adam. Enter the brothel. The place is considered disgusting and dirty, and it is the custom of the community to treat people there as contemptible. But you, as ustaz adam, have a good motive, you want to find light or people who want to return to the divine path. It's like you in this case. You entered a place that may seem cursed to some people, but if your intentions are good, hear me out my man, God willing, God will make all your affairs easier Ok, ok...... Another example. You go to a factory to make perfume. You have no intention of buying perfume. You just want to walk. But every time you pass by, someone must give you a free strip for you to test the smell. You've been tempted for a long time. Because yes, the perfume is delicious. So, in this case, the same thing might happen to you. I'm not saying you'll be evil. But the devil's tricks are cunning. You really intend to enter the perfume factory, you don't want to buy pape, but last but not least, your whole body smells good and you bought 1 or 2 bottles. In your case, I'm afraid, the devil will incite you to go down the wrong path. I don't want to pray for you to go astray or anything bad. I hope you don't think so. But, I'm sure, with your intentions, God will reward your efforts. But I don't want anything bad to happen to you bro. So, the conclusion...... Hehe....... If you join that group, with a good reason, to seek knowledge, continue. Find useful knowledge. Do not give up. But you have to be careful. Do not deviate from the original intention.

I understand this. if there are morals and good practices it is not an issue. ] Not all men are like you... not all men are like you are cases of rape and lewdness [ so that's the human problem. that's what I'm saying if morals and practices are right it's not a problem. It's like if someone steals, is it the fault of the stolen or the thief? same as other crimes. the fault of the criminal not the fault of the victim. ] Yes, it's the thief's fault, but we're here to provide a place where it's hard for theft to happen...for example, selling pure gold just like selling it at the night market. If the gold is stolen, is it the thief's fault? Yes, it's the thief's fault, but to prevent the theft from happening again, the store here will upgrade the store's security system [that's what I'm focusing on. if those who study and teach religious knowledge fail, how can they make religion a regret. the way you look at this issue is wrong. non-Muslims are not an issue in Malaysia, but Muslims are. ] There are many schools that molest students, should the whole school be closed? There are many police officers who are corrupt, should the police institution be closed? The ustaz should be punished, and the selection of other teachers should be tightened and continue as usual, add more cctv to ensure the safety of students. In conclusion, all laws and education need to be towards Islamic values, you can't do it all at once, you can do it a little at a time. But the reality now is that Malaysia is becoming more secular, and religious values are disappearing, see what happens to Christians in Europe, the same thing may happen to Muslims in Malaysia",1,Ajar_Malaysia,1652096808.0,2022-05-09,Reasonable_Bill996,Malay

sample_33,"TRIBUNWOW.COM, JAKARTA - The Governor of DKI Jakarta, who is also the Candidate for Governor of DKI Jakarta (cagub) for the 2017-2022 period, Basuki Tjahaja Purnama or Ahok, was suddenly furious when the inauguration of the Mbah Priok Cemetery Park, Jalan Pasar Koja, Koja District, North Jakarta, took place , Saturday (4/3/2017). At the location of the inauguration, Ahok, who wanted to speak in front of all residents and managers, was shocked when he found out that there was a fatal mistake, in the contents of the Decree (SK) for the inauguration of the historic site, it became a Cultural Heritage. The fatal error referred to and annoyed the former East Belitung Regent, namely in the contents of the decree it was written 'Allegedly Cultural Heritage'. Ahok claimed that at a leadership meeting (rapim) some time ago, it was discussed that the sentence should be changed to read 'Protected as Cultural Heritage'. ""Wow, this isn't true. It's time for the word suspected again. I think this is Batman's trap. I changed it yesterday if there isn't another word suspected. Wow, this isn't true,"" said Ahok, irritably glaring at his entourage. According to Ahok, the word ""allegedly"" means unclear. Ahok's anger was due to a fatal error in writing the contents of the SK, which also made the community, along with the congregation and visitors to the Mbah Priok Cemetery Park, also furious. No doubt, Ahok's mistake also made all residents and administrators wonder about the fatal error in the contents of the decree. ""Find the person who deliberately changed the decree. Just kill it. Fire it, fire it! Why is Islamic history so a toy? That's impudent, Pak Ahok!"" he said. The Head of the DKI Jakarta Tourism and Culture Service (Kadis), Catur Laswanto, who is known to have held and provided the unrevised decree, could not hide his embarrassment. Trying to stand in front of residents, managers and visitors at the Mbah Priok Cemetery Park, made Catur break out in cold sweat. Seen from a distance, Catur was nodding his head while talking to Ahok, whose face was red with anger. While showing SK to Catur, Ahok immediately spoke curtly again. ""What's wrong with SK like this? It's not right to be like this,"" said Ahok angrily while hitting and occasionally touching the SK paper, in front of Catur. Ahok's emotions are unstoppable. Residents, managers and visitors alike seemed to be blushing hot, when Catur could only lower his head and nod his head when Ahok sprayed him. At that time, Chess immediately left the location and returned carrying three pieces of paper that SK knew were the real ones. Ahok shook his head and got even angrier when he found out that the original decree on the inauguration of the Mbah Priok Cemetery was still kept neatly by Catur. All residents who were present at the inauguration site were even more surprised when they saw Catur carrying the original SK. ""So that's the original (SK). Why did Pak Ahok give the SK that hasn't been revised? Do you want to trap Pak Ahok using a fake SK?"" shouted a resident who witnessed the inauguration. Ahok also shouted, ""Once you find out that something is wrong, the original comes out. I want to say that the sentence is protected and enforced as a cultural heritage site. It's impudent to still use the word allegedly like this,"" Ahok said annoyed. Ahok then crossed out the DKI Governor's SK paper, which was a fatal mistake. Ahok suddenly asked for a pen and scribbled on the SK, which the residents considered to be fake. ""Where's the pen. Here, I crossed out the wrong one,"" Ahok said annoyed, then sat back down grumbling. (WartaKota/Panji Baskhara Ramadhan)",0,indonesia,1488850607.0,2017-03-07,runeza43,Indonesian

sample_480,"Purwokerto: Even though Purwokerto is not a cultural city / cultural center, the government immediately cleaned up the old / old / former Dutch buildings. Still, there will be attractions of its own if the old Purwokerto building is renovated, developed and repurposed, not demolished. The layout of the city is also good (Did you realize why the town square of Java must have a banyan tree and a road in the middle? There is logic and ""meaning"" behind it, you know). In fact, the construction was not a modernization of the square, but instead the layout of the square was muzzled. The architecture of the mosque next to the main square is made generic and not a mix of Javanese and modern art. The construction of the mall could have been originally placed in the south, after all, the mall would become crowded. Purwokerto originally had 2 stations. One was muzzled by Suharto for the sake of a reeee's car. This old station is going to be made into a mall. Again. facepalm. If at that time it wasn't muzzled but modernized, Purwokerto-Wonosobo is not stuck now. It can even be extended to Temanggung - Semarang by another way. It has its own attractions too. This original city is full of growth and has become the capital of Banyumas from the train. Even now, Purwokerto is still a big station and all trains stop here. But they wasted it. Purwokerto was also not separated into a municipality, but as an administrative city during the Soeharto era, it continued to be merged. Tegal is just a madya city. Now there is talk of expansion, but the plan is stupid. The expansion of the Purwokerto area in the south is too expansive (although the west, north and east expansions are correct). Banyumas itself (outside Purwokerto) wants to split into 2. This is wrong. Banyumas is not that big yet. --------- For the Banyumas district itself, local businesses are not enlarged and industrialized. Mount Slamet was originally capable of producing geothermal energy but it is not being used enough. Gerak Serayu Dam can be made into hydropower but not used. Banyumas Regency in the 2000s was too focused on Purwokerto (a side effect of Purwokerto not being separated into a municipality).",1,indonesia,1655287152.0,2022-06-15,IceFl4re,Indonesian

sample_97,"Ah, this is a simplification of a concrete problem that is too complex and no one knows the practical solution. Remember when Greta Thunderberg gave a speech about the climate change emergency and what was Putin's response? Putin likes his youthful vigor but he is a political mount. Putin said something like this; Everyone wants nature to be sustainable. However, the most important thing is that all third world countries want to live a prosperous and developed life like European and Scandinavian countries. The problem is these countries have gone through the era of industrialization which spewed hundreds of millions of tons of carbon into the atmosphere and the carbon that we give to nature is far from being comparable to what they have given. The number of trees now is many times more than 100 years ago and will continue to grow. Indeed, many trees are important in overcoming climate change, but the most important thing is to reduce carbon and energy use drastically and switch to renewable energy. Yes, even then there are still many who doubt this renewable energy because apart from being expensive, you still have to mine too. That is, suppose the Government of Indonesia is concerned with nature. Reducing the use of palm oil, mining and so on. The budget is reduced, which means the Human Development Index is reduced. The contribution of carbon use will only decrease by a certain percentage. Climate change is still haunting us while our hunger and lack of literacy rates are still increasing. Because, so far what humans still know is HUMAN WELFARE DIRECTLY COMPARED TO THE EXPLOITATION OF NATURAL RESOURCES. The biggest contribution to carbon emissions comes from our food. Starting from beef and other livestock to agriculture that uses fertilizers to produce more. The funny thing is that sending food from Argentina to Southeast Asia by container ship per can of food is far more cost-effective in carbon emissions than sending food between cities and between provinces. What does it mean? Overcoming climate change is becoming difficult because it is the responsibility of all sectors of humanity. Starting from the rich people who live hedonistically on cruise ships and jet planes to the poor who only think about their stomachs. Starting from politicians and businessmen to workers who live from day to day. Everyone wants nature to be fresh and prosperous, but no one is willing to cut the human population in half, or not eat rendang anymore, or the price of the contents goes from two thousand to ten thousand one because the CPO is reduced, or the cellphone or internet is removed because of all that. need energy and still no one knows the best energy even that superpower country. Talking about Indonesia and third world countries so they care about nature is like seeing Putri Tanjung talk about success in life. Pointless and insensitive. Now answering the OP's question. Why is Indonesian awareness of the environment still low? Because our GDP is still low. Our HDI is still low. If you look at the graph, you will find a correlation between GDP and human concern for nature. How to increase GDP and HDI? What if it's not development? Natural exploitation, infrastructure development. Building decent schools. Nutrition for babies and children so that their brains develop and are not stupid like people nowadays. So, if you read Minister Siti's words, it will make sense, especially if you read the previous speech. Deforestation cannot stop in the name of development. Actually, this is in line with the results of the world conference on climate change and nature. Siti's speech also came out a few days after the results of the conference. Compromise on third world countries also have the right to development and exploitation of nature. So, deforestation is still UNDERSTANDED right up to 2030. There is time until 2030 for Indonesia to connect small areas and increase GDP significantly so that what you want, awareness of the importance of nature, is achieved.

If you have any input, I'll be very grateful.** it makes sense, not too tight... it's just that it doesn't get too much to say, isn't this going to make people like ""ah I want to go alone/shouldn't I go to the xyz place instead of together"" or not? Besides that, for Friday... if you're taking the bus, why aren't your items stored on the bus? Check in later, go home and play like that (if you don't stay past the bus route). >2. **There is 1 person who has GERD. You can't eat late, you have to eat at 7 o'clock. I'm thinking about buying a snack box for Friday and Saturday, how about that? ** I agree for this, it's better to provide a rather heavy snack box like sponge cake, bananas also help. Don't forget besides gerd ones, also provide lots of antimo... 😅😅 > 3. ** Looking for a tour guide or don't you need an event in Bedugul? Any tour guide recommendations? I think this vacation is already similar to a field trip, why not all of them lol instead of just taking selfies.** I don't think I need to use a tourguide, especially if you don't intend to study history like that... assuming at most you can only visit 3-4 places a day, if you already know Where do you want to go, it's better to save on guide costs. Bedugul is Friday right? It's close there, if it's still noon, you can go back to Tanah Lot. In that area there is also the Kipu Kebo waterfall. >4. **Group bookings for Family Room are actually more economical. But, the risk is that there are families who are combined because there are 5 beds per room. Should I go for it? Or just keep booking deluxe? Our budget is 250 thousand per pax per night, including breakfast. So, because I got a price offer for a Family Room of 1 million / night / 5 pax including breakfast at a beach resort, in my opinion that's a really good price ** How many teenagers are there sis? If you want it delicious, usually the same age can be combined like that, cousins. Love them in the family room, so their parents can also be alone. Sometimes the children are put in a separate room which is a family room, then they ask who sleeps with them... so the big ones feel good on their own too. Apart from that, another suggestion is to rent a villa with lots of rooms... as far as I know it's not that expensive for 10 people or more. Now it might be more expensive, but before the rate for a 4-room villa was only 1.7 million, it could fit 10-12 people, it's a bit remote... but it's nice because it has a private pool, breakfast, and so on. >5. **A normal beach resort or hotel?** If you focus on traveling, it's an ordinary hotel. If you are going to be careless in a hotel with your family, resort or villa. >6. **Recommendation for a friendly group lunch where the food is NOT seafood. Babi is fine. But, there must be soft and soupy food because it's hard for the simbah to chew. ** hmm, I don't know that there are many elderly people 😅😅. But mostly if you make a reservation, it's good everywhere. I forgot that there used to be a place to eat bamboo like that in Ubud, once we were 30 people so it was like renting one room alone to eat it... but really forgot what it was called. >7. **I want Sunday mass at church. Are the requirements the same as face-to-face Masses in Jakarta?

That was the second time, the first that happened a few months ago, Mas X shouted at one of his children, saying ""come on, you're a boy, you can't do that, that's a sissy, that's a sissy"". Well, as I said, the youngest son is around 4 years old, so maybe he scolded his young-adult (oldest) son? But his other son, the oldest one, is only 10 years old.... Ten. Fucking. Years. old. And he scolded the kid for not being 'manly enough'. Want to ran a little. Previously I was suspicious why this room was empty, even though it was on the first floor, near the kitchen. Rent for a month is also quite expensive for boarding students, 1.5 mil IDR. But the air conditioner was broken, the report was never responded to, the room had black mold growing even though every day the door was opened so that it was exposed to sunlight. When the ceiling, aka the atep of my bathroom, collapsed and the lights went out, Mas X even grumbled. And now I have to take a shower in the dark because the light that was installed is off again, aka the lamp that was given is used, because it only turns on for a few weeks... And they hate cats, there is a cat that I diligently feed and want to take home in August, really afraid that the cat will be killed by Mas X first, sigh... Anyway, back to their worst treat.

And many of us also ""break"" the chain of ""inheritance"" when we ourselves become parents as we are today. > It's not unusual if when you were a teenager and got menarche (first menstruation) then your mother introduced you sanitary pads, of course a certain brand. > Even though most of you have changed to other brands from the brand introduced decades ago by your mother, I am pretty sure that is the brand you are buying now, which you also ""inherit"" to your young women. > Likewise ''offal'', aka underwear, whether it's underwear (boys or girls) or bras, it's impossible for you to buy another brand for your children, different from the brand you're wearing now. > This is what is called the ""family of procreation"", which passes on to their children, mostly unconsciously, it is only done automatically as it flows in our daily lives. > **Trends** > It is undeniable that Bill Gates, Steve Jobs and Mark Zuckerberg are three revolutionary figures in the 20th and 21st Century. Bill Gates with his Windows, Steve Jobs with his Apple (iPhone, iOS, iPad), Mark Zuckerberg with his Facebook. > The gadget revolution began in 2007 when Apple launched the iPhone for the first time and continued with the following series. It was at this moment that the revolution of modern devices with touch, dulit (swipe) and jiwit (pinch) began. Since then, the old paradigm of all kinds of communication tools has collapsed. > Social media was slow in the days before Facebook. There's MySpace, Friendster, various blogs, and so on. Since Facebook, the way people socialize, communicate and connect with each other has changed. > If there are still many who call it virtual world, I prefer to call it virtual. The technology and social media revolution continues with BBM, Twitter, Instagram, Line, Whatsapp, WeChat, KakaoTalk, and many more. > The technological revolution and social media have made a world without borders. What happened elsewhere we know at a glance. Indonesia is one of the most active social media users in the world. > However, this technological revolution has not been matched by a sufficient revolution in understanding and education so that Indonesians are the most existential and the most religious in the world. Read: Most Existing and Religious Indonesians in the World. > **Underpants** > Due to the disclosure of all kinds of information. The trend of underwear around the world is also easily recognized by Indonesians. In other countries there was a underwear revolution. > Shows waddling on the catwalk wearing only ""innards"" were held everywhere. People are vying with each other with the most trending panties that are boasted everywhere. > It didn't take long for the Indonesian people to slowly follow this trend of underwear. Underpants that were originally worn inside – as the name implies – more and more people started wearing them outside. Initially a few, but more and more stylish like Superman and Batman who do wear their underwear on the outside (with pride). > Just like the superhero, more and more people are wearing underwear outside. Everywhere the question was heard: “what brand are your underwear?”. Even though it should be a person wearing underwear or not is an individual right, moreover what brand should not be asked. > The Victoria's Secret brand is considered the most beautiful underwear benchmark. Because of the frequent VS waddling performances on the catwalk, this brand is increasingly global. > The point is you have to be VS, it doesn't matter what you buy, you can buy it or not, it's original or not, the important thing is VS or like VS or similar to VS, whether you want the original for millions or fake from Pasar Baru or Mangga Dua it doesn't matter, the important thing is VS and worn outside for others to see and praise. > More and more people forget the nature and function of ""innards"", which should be for self-comfort, hygiene and sanitation and don't need to be shown to the outside, now they are even competing to be exhibited. > The contents inside are no longer important, whether it's itching, itching, panuan, scabies, ringworm, ringworm, smell, it doesn't matter; pubic hair that is not kept clean, instead it becomes lice and klewers sticking out everywhere it doesn't matter; itchy and scaly hives are also not a problem; torn, worn, faded, worn pants and shirts are also not a problem, the important thing is that the panties (and bra) are VS, worn outside and shown off to everyone. > Those who don't wear VS ""innards"" are considered not trendy, not fashionable and out of date, are considered strange creatures and slowly begin to be reviled, made fun of, ostracized. > And sporadically those who couldn't be seen wearing their underwear outside started to be raided, told to take off their outer clothes to see the brand of their underwear, if not VS in several places they started to force it, basically, you have to be VS, you can't or not. If it's not VS it's wrong! > Even though there are lots of underwear and bra brands: GT Man, Rider, Hings, Crocodile, Pierre Cardin, Polo, Wacoal, Triumph, Sloggi, DKNY, Freya, Sorella, Calvin Klein and many more. > There are also many models, sports models, boxers, g-strings, bras with hooks at the back or front, too many colors, the classic white, then black, pink, colorful, patterned and even batik. > All of them function to be worn on the inside, for comfort, decency, health, hygiene, sanitation and to protect our ""innards"". > Ah, more and more people around the world are forgetting the nature of the benefits and functions of underwear. It's called panties, it should be inside, for yourself, not to show off outside like Superman and Batman. i like the analogy though however, he forgot that even batman and superman doesn't wear underwear on the outside anymore",0,indonesia,1496034339.0,2017-05-29,Rastya,Indonesian

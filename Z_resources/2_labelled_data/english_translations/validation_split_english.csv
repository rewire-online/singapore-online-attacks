This regulation has been in effect since January 9, 2015 it prohibits the use of trawls and seine nets. (Read: List of Susi's Moments as a Minister.) > Chairman of the Tegal City Fishermen's Association (PNKT) Eko Susanto said that banning the use of dragnet trawlers and dragging them is tantamount to killing fishermen. According to him, around 80 percent of fishing boats on the North Coast (Pantura) of Central Java use the cantrang dogol (danish seine) fishing gear. In Article 4 paragraph 2 of Minister of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries Regulation Number 2 of 2015, dogol is one of six types of trawlers pulled by boats (boat or vessel seines). > Apart from rejecting the regulations stipulated by Minister Susi Pudjiastuti, fishermen are also urging the government to revoke Presidential Regulation Number 191 of 2014 concerning Provision, Distribution and Retail Selling Prices of fuel oil. ""This regulation also kills fishermen because it prohibits ships over 30 gross tonnage (GT) from using subsidized diesel,"" said Eko. (Read: Minister Susi Pudjiastuti Should Have Done This.) > One of the boat owners from Tegalsari Village, West Tegal District, Tambari, said that so far the government has collected a fish auction levy of 2.78 percent.

sample_567,"My opinion might be inclined because of 2 aspects, historical and genetic: **Historical**: 1. Indonesia as we know it today is a ""product"" of a completely new identity. Unlike China and India. The concept of Chinese and Indian identity has been around longer, especially in European literature, so they are more familiar with the characteristics of Chinese/Indian culture. Meanwhile, Indonesia also has a fairly *new* culture that Westerners can think of as Chinese/Indian/even Muslim Arabs. 2. Indonesia was colonized by the Dutch whose most productive colonies were in Indonesia, especially Java. Think about it, what do other ethnic groups become part of the diaspora for? One of them is because of colonization, like how Africans were taken as slaves in America, Indians became slaves in South Africa etc. They were transferred to become human workers in the gardens belonging to the occupiers. Meanwhile in Indonesia, only Javanese are ""exported"" to Suriname, while Indonesians from other islands are brought to work in Java-Sumatra. 3. Indonesia is relatively stable in recent history because it was colonized by the Dutch for 3 centuries. Compare that to China which was in chaos because of the Opium war and others. One of the driving forces for ethnic Chinese to become diaspora in the US was because they tried to try their luck after being in chaos in their own country, akin to being a ""refugee"". Even though in the end the US is also enslaved, digging mines etc. For Indonesia there is no flow of refugees like that, after all if you want to try your luck you can still go to a nearby island (Java/Sumatra) you don't need to cross continents. **Genetic**: 1. Indonesians who can speak English usually don't have an accent or can even absorb foreign accents well. So they are less identified as ‚Äúforeigners‚Äù even though abroad. 2. Indonesians can be mistaken for Chinese, Indian, and even Negro (My mother was even mistaken for a Negro by white kids in the US when she was little). So Westerners cannot differentiate between Indonesians and non-Indonesians. 3. Take a look at Indonesian mulatto children, most of them immediately lose their Indonesian elements (especially those with Caucasians).

sample_135,"Just got this from WA broadcast message *WHY PRABOWO SHOULD BE THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA?* This is the answer By Asyari Usman (Senior Journalist from BBC London) - Tuesday, 6 November 2018 In this long article, I will explain why Prabowo Subianto (PS) must be president. Why Prabowo? Many suggested that they should write about the reasons for giving a mandate to Mr. PS. If you want to give a short answer, here is the answer: this country is in a critical condition, it needs a ""fully equipped"" president to overcome it. A ‚Äúfully armed‚Äù president. Complete with intelligence, honesty and firmness. Visionary. The President who donated his body and soul for the betterment of Indonesia. Prabowo Subianto fulfilled the check-list above. He has those qualifications. Plus, Prabowo has the following track record, capabilities and characters. Mr. PS is clean from corruption. Cannot be dictated. Know the problems faced by Indonesia and know what the solution is. Know anyone business bandits. Knows everyone who is greedy. And know how to deal with them if he sits as president. Prabowo is not an ambitious person seeking power, but he has the ambition to elevate the standard of living and dignity of the Indonesian people. Mr. PS already has everything if his only goal is to live in comfort, without thinking about the future of the nation and state. The wealth he has can fulfill any of his worldly desires. He doesn't need to bother walking around the village, meeting small farmers and thinking about them. If Mr. PS decides to live comfortably in Switzerland or wherever is the most comfortable and expensive place in the world, he can get it. There is no need for Mr. PS to have to face insults and insults from enemies who are not happy with him because of his political struggle to liberate Indonesia from robbery, fraud, oppression, impoverishment and large-scale poverty. Mr. PS made thousands of enemies because of his determination to save Indonesia. Because of this quality of thought and personality, we deserve to entrust the presidency to Pak Prabowo. At this time, none of the big robbers masked as businessmen, were happy about PS's struggles. None of the corrupt and rotten politicians are willing to have Pak PS sit as president. However, Mr. PS took a heavy risk to seize power because he was very angry with the robbers who colluded with the authorities. That is, executive rulers, political rulers, and conglomerate-scale business-economic rulers who have long enjoyed the fruits of their robbery and oppression. Now Pak PS feels the risk. He is despised by a consortium of corrupt rulers and business bandits. It is this evil consortium that is working to block Prabowo from running for the 2019 presidential election. Are you still asking why Prabowo is ""obliged"" to become president next year? Because Mr. PS is not so and so or so and so who is easily tricked or mugged. Who can be colluded with. He would not humble himself in front of the economic imperialist powers. He would not be able to be suppressed by any foreign power. He understood how to deal with people who had been worshiped by the lecherous consortium all along. A consortium that is only concerned with increasing personal wealth by plundering the country's natural resources. A consortium of scumbag businessmen-rulers-politicians who profit from the suffering of the people. Why Prabowo? Because America, PRC, Europe or anyone else can't control it. He will be good friends with them. Sit low, stand equal. Mutual respect. But Prabowo will not be fooled by the multi-national companies that come to this country relying on their government's political pressure. This practice will be stopped by Prabowo once he is sworn in as president. Prabowo is not a person with an ‚Äúinferior‚Äù mentality. Not lowly. Facing the greedy tycoons, he would stand tall. Facing international forums and journalists, he would not stutter, let alone gasp. If you want to see the President's palace and official residence or private residence empty of dirty lobbies for business and projects, let's seat Pak Prabowo as RI-1. If you want to see the KPK work harder with the results of the throngs of corruptors, let's vote for Prabowo as president. If you want to see Indonesia's corruption index drop drastically, Prabowo is the president. Perhaps you are not satisfied with asking, what else is Prabowo's reason for having to sit as president? If you want a long description, no problem. Because there are still many serious and critical problems in this country that have not been mentioned. Pertamina is on the verge of a big problem even though the Managing Director Arif Budiman denies this. But he acknowledged that Pertamina was under heavy pressure. The national pride airline, Garuda Indonesia, has been flying in uncertain conditions for a long time. There is a threat of bankruptcy. The employees warned that they did not want Garuda to stumble like Merpati. PLN is threatened with bankruptcy if electricity rates are not raised. The State Gas Company (PGN) is also under threat. They are looking for a loan of 11 trillion. Meanwhile, BRI issued follow-on bonds of 2.44 trillion for business development. Observers interpreted this as a harbinger of liquidity crunch. This is, among other things, the bad condition of state companies that was revealed to the public. Four of the BUMNs above are important nodes of the country's economy. Whatever the reasons for the threat of bankruptcy, it is clear that this is a picture of the performance of the regime in power. They can't wash their hands. For the people, of course, this condition cannot be allowed to continue. National leadership must be in the hands of people with capability and capacity. This is absent in a country that has a fairly high level of complexity. That is why Prabowo Subianto's presidency absolutely must be presented in the April 17 2019 presidential election. Maybe you are in doubt. Because the incumbent ruler is supported by many important and smart people. You would say this regime is not problematic. This regime is correct.

sample_458,"I don't understand the ideology. Yes, like out there ""welfare state"" = ""socialism"", here ""communist"" = ""atheist"" etc. But when asked what the communists did, they only ""killed the generals"" and ""atheists"". Actually, it's also true, usually communists are often atheists or at least subjugating religions. But communism in Indonesia, at least Marhaenis, isn't that anti-religious either, at least as far as I know. But it seems there is fear you know. Afraid that it will spread, people become atheists and destroy social orders (social orders like ""eastern culture"" & ""decency"" etc.). Oh yes, please - communism doesn't use money.

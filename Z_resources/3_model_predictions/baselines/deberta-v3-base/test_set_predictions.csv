Then do you think the organization is more important than the lecture itself? in determining employment? that's not the reality. Try those who say ""finding a job is easy"", explain in detail what they mean. No one can, always floating abstract unclear, ""connection"" or something. From here, the idea already *flawed*. If your goal is to make acquaintances, then get to know people you know well first, what do you do with a *stranger*? Do strangers want to help you? What's more, if you go to the same university and major, it's difficult for people to even ask for connections, how can you help? In my opinion, it's just seniors' tricks, pressuring juniors to join the organization because if no one joins, they will be arrogant, useless. Actually, the point is they want to say ""find connections"", so that later graduates can beg for mercy. Especially if you work in the private sector, the system is too profitable for insiders.

rewire_singapore_290,"Still in cold war with boyfriend. Probably because last walk yesterday I was a lot quiet and didn't respond to what he said. I rarely get mad for more than 2 or 3 days, and usually when my boyfriend is angry it's me who tries to calm him down and act as a cushion until he cools off. The problem is, my silence a few days ago was an accumulation of things that had happened before. I consider my partner as a support system for whatever my endeavor is. I used to be able to like him because he listened to almost every gobbledygook and gibberish things I spat. Even when I scored a 2-point basket last night on a pick-up basketball game, she listened enthusiastically. But lately that trait is gone. Since earlier this year I complained to her that my child really wants to be heard, I also really like listening to anyone's story and try to be really enthusiastic while keeping eye contact. Especially my partner's stories. But the thing is... She rarely got interested in my stories. Just tell me a little bit and then come back to the topic later. ""Just shrug it off, you're the man"", for so long, yes. But lately, because I have plans to get married, I also want her to be my support system, right? It doesn't feel good to have to be a 100% listener without being heard when telling a story. Because I like to write, so sometimes I like to share my writing with him, and sometimes it's a way for me to release a stress, so sometimes I like to write on IG stories, it's a bit cryptic like that. But many ask me why but she never did. ""Why don't you just tell him directly?"" honestly already, and honestly, deep inside, there is a desire even once or twice to be understood even though through writing. Hell, it's been 6 years, can't you remember the pattern? I could even tell she's not in a good mood if the chat answers already have a certain pattern. Plus, the more I come here, the more I feel that I should take good care and love myself. In the past, it was difficult for me to stand up for things I know I deserve, now I feel more and more urgent to do so, so I feel stupid observing other things, including this case. Idk, fam. Maybe because I had a trauma from my parents getting divorced a long time ago and my step parents had their own problems, so I have a benchmark for the score which will be better, that is.",0,indonesia,1542617229.0,2018-11-19,Indonesian,0.12844086

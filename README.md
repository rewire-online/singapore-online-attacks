Improving the Detection of Multilingual Online Attacks with Rich Social Media Data from Singapore
---

Using the multilingual city-state of Singapore as a starting point, we collected a **large corpus of Reddit comments in Indonesian, Malay, Singlish and other dialects, and provide fine-grained hierarchical labels for online attacks**. For more information on the data collection and annotation processes, a full analysis of the annotated data as well as a presentation of baseline and experimental classification models please see the paper [under review]. 

We publish the corpus with rich metadata (to be found in `0_dataset/1_dataset/`),  an automatic English translation (`0_dataset/2_dataset_translated/`) as well as additional unlabelled data for domain adaptation (`0_dataset/3_unlabelled_data/`). More information on the dataset and its creation can be found in the README file located in the `0_dataset/` directory.

An analysis of the dataset and experiments conducted using the newly collected data can be found in `1_experiments/`.
